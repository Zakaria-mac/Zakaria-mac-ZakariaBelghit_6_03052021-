Creation of the back-end application of 'So Pekocko'.

'So Pekocko' is a food company speciliazed in the creation of innovative hot sauces. 
The application aims at allowing new users to choose their favorite sauce by liking it. 
They will get also the possibility of dislinking it if they didn't appreciate the experience with a particular sauce.

In order to create the back-end of the application and a secured API, I will be using : 
• Node.js; 
• Framework Express; 
• MongoDB Atlas for the creation of the API; 
• Plug-in Mongoose.

      *************
      
Furthermore, if you re looking to open the application from you computer, you will need to install the runtime Node JS and the framework Angular :
- Node.js (V 12.14 or 14.0)
- Angular (V 7.0.2.)
- node-sass (V 4.14+.)

Clone the project.

Then, go to the front-end file, execute : 
- npm install
- ng serve

You can go to http://localhost:4200/.
You will have access to the front-page of the 'So Pekocko' application.
