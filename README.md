Creation of the back-end application of 'So Pekocko'.

'So Pekocko' is a food company speciliazed in the creation of innovative hot sauces. 
The application aims at allowing new users to choose their favorite sauce by liking it. 
They will get also the possibility of dislinking it if they didn't appreciate the experience with a particular sauce.

In order to create the back-end of the application and a secured API, I will be using :
	•	Node.js
	•	Framework Express
	•	MongoDB Atlas for the creation of the API.
	•	Plug-in Mongoose.
